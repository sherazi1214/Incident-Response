# Incident-Response


**English:** Incident Response is the structured approach to handle and manage the aftermath of a cyber incident or breach.

**Urdu:** IR ka matlab hai ek planned process jisme security team attack ko detect, control aur fix karti hai aur system ko wapis secure state me laati hai.

Lessons Learned / Root Cause Analysis

**Urdu:** Ye ek cycle hai jisme har stage next stage ko feed karti hai.

## Validation

**English:** Confirming if the detected event is a true security incident or just a false alarm.

**Urdu:** Matlab ye check karna ke alert sach me incident hai ya sirf ek misconfiguration/false alarm hai.

## Prioritization (a.k.a. Triage / Periodization)

**English:** Assigning severity and priority to incidents (High, Medium, Low).

**Urdu:** Matlab pehle critical system ka issue solve karna aur phir kam importance wale.

## Containment

**English:** Isolating the incident to prevent further damage.

**Urdu:** Matlab damage ko stop karna, jaise infected system ko network se isolate karna.

## Eradication

**English:** Removing the root cause of the incident (malware, vulnerability, backdoor).

**Urdu:** Matlab jo asal problem hai (virus, exploit, attacker ka access) usko completely nikal dena.

## Recovery

**English:** Restoring systems back to normal operation with monitoring.

**Urdu:** Matlab system ko dobara online lana aur continuously monitor karna ke dubara problem na aaye.

## Root Cause Analysis (RCA) – Components

What Happened? (Description)

Why Did It Happen? (Cause – e.g. unpatched software)

How Could It Have Been Prevented? (Controls missing)

Corrective Action (Fix applied)

Preventive Action (Future protection)

**Urdu:** RCA ka matlab hai gahrayi me jakar asal wajah samajhna aur usko permanently fix karna.

## Lessons Learned

**English:** Documenting findings, updating policies, and improving playbooks for future incidents.

**Urdu:** Matlab jo galti hui usse seekhna aur future me same mistake repeat na karna.

## Quick Recap Mix:

**IR**= detect → validate → prioritize → contain → eradicate → recover → learn.

**Validation** = check if real incident.

**Prioritization** = rank severity.

**Containment** = stop spread.

**Eradication** = remove threat.

**Recovery** = restore system.

**RCA** = find real cause.

**Lessons learned** = improve defenses.
